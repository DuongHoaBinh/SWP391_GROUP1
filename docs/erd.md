# Entity Relationship Design

The executable schema is `database/schema.mysql.sql` and targets MySQL 8.0+ with InnoDB and utf8mb4.

## Core entities

- `role`, `user`, `otp_verification`
- `horse`
- `regulation`, `transport_document`, `document_approval`
- `shipment`, `shipment_horse`
- `vehicle`, `shipment_vehicle`, `route`, `route_stop`, `shipment_assignment`
- `route_stop_update`, `horse_condition_log`, `attachment`
- `incident_report`, `shipment_change_request`, `delivery_handover`
- `notification`

## Important relationships

- A customer owns one or more horses and creates transport orders.
- An order contains one or more horses and can become one transport plan/trip.
- A horse has a document set whose required documents depend on destination country and border gate.
- A trip uses a route made of ordered legs and stops, and has assigned vehicle/capacity and staff.
- Tracking events and horse health logs belong to a trip and record their author and timestamp.
- Incidents can create route-change and additional-cost approval records linked to the trip.
- Handover records close a trip only after the required horse/document checklist is confirmed.

The database schema is the executable source of truth; this document explains ownership and relationships at a business level.

# API Documentation

## API technology

The backend is implemented with **NestJS and TypeScript**. It exposes a **REST API** consumed by the **React/Next.js frontend**. Request and response DTOs should be documented with OpenAPI/Swagger.

API contracts are organized by backend module:

- `/api/auth`
- `/api/orders` - requests, manager approval, assignments
- `/api/documents` - horse document sets, requirements, reviews, authority approvals
- `/api/compliance` - country, border-gate, quarantine, and customs rules
- `/api/fleet` - vehicles, aircraft capacity, stalls, availability
- `/api/routes` - route plans, legs, stops, schedule changes
- `/api/tracking` - trip status, route events, horse health logs, attachments
- `/api/incidents` - emergency reports, escalation, route/cost changes (optional)
- `/api/handover` - delivery checklist and acceptance (optional)
- `/api/notifications` - customer and internal alerts
- `/api/reports` - revenue, operating cost, and on-time delivery

## Contract rules

- Every mutation returns the updated resource status and an audit identifier.
- Status-changing endpoints must validate the actor's role and resource ownership.
- File upload endpoints must return attachment metadata, not expose local file paths.
- Tracking events are append-only; corrections are new events with a reason.
- Emergency route or cost changes require manager approval before publication.

Document request/response examples here as each module reaches an agreed contract.
